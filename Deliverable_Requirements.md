## Abstract

This is the Requirements Document for the EUMETNET Supplementary Observations
dataHub (E-SOH). This document outlines the technical requirements and
objectives for the development of E-SOH, which is a component of the Federated
European Meteorological Data Infrastructure (FEMDI) program. The objective of
E-SOH is to provide a sustainable and standardized system for sharing real-time
meteorological observations in line with the World Meteorological
Organization's (WMO) Information System 2.0 (WIS 2.0) strategy and the European
Union's (EU) regulation on Meteorological High Value Data (HVD).

## Introduction
This is the Requirements Document for the RODEO WP6 for sharing weather radar data. This document outlines the technical requirements and objectives for the development of radar data supply, which utilizes components developed in the the EUMETNET Federated European Meteorological Data Infrastructure (FEMDI) programme. The objective of work in WP6 is utilize the data sharing done in the EUMETNET OPERA programme already over a decase and, build on this collaboration a data supply for the third-party users in line with the World Meteorological Organization’s (WMO) Information System 2.0 (WIS 2.0) strategy and the European Union’s (EU) regulation on Meteorological High Value Data (HVD).

This document is intended for the development team, stakeholders, and anyone interested in the technical specifications of WP6 weather radar data supply. It includes a detailed description of the system’s functional and non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and risks.

We hope that this document will serve as a clear guide for the development and implementation of work performed in WP6 for radar data supply and help ensure its successful integration with the FEMDI programme and within RODEO-project.
